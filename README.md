This simple plugin will automatically identify any PDF URL that is in an <a> tag and open it in a pdf.js lightbox when the <a> tag is clicked.
The toolbar has been removed from the lightbox so there is no option to download the PDF and the right click has been disabled on the lightbox, to further discourage downloading the PDF.

Simply download the .zip of this repo and add it as a plugin in WordPress.

Enjoy :)
